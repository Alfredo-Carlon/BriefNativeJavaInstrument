# SimpleObjectCreation_v2.0

This example is a kind of Hello World example of bytecode instrumentation.
It reports every call to a constructor of a loaded class and tagged class.

### Compile/Run:
To Compile the example just run
```bash
$make
```
inside the example's root directory (simpleObjectCreation_v2.0). Note that
libBNI.dylib must be already constructed.
	
To Run the example:
```
$cd bin
$java -agentlib:NativeAgent Test
```

### Notes:

A thread safe class that keeps track of loaded classes and created objects
is implemented. 
	
To know which thread allocated the object, we keep track of the JNIEnv
pointer sent to say_hello. This may not be accurate because two threads
may share the same JNIEnv address if one executes after the other's deallocation.
	
For the momment anonymous and reflection generated classes are not tagged.
It seems the tagging strategy does not work with this type of classes.
However the calling to sayHello does work if performed without a tag.

At the end the native agent writes a file with the recorded actions.

For more interesting outputs, DaCapo test suite, for example, can be instrumented.
